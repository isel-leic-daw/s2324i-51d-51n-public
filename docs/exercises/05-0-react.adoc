== Periodic Fetcher [[periodic_fetcher]]

Create a component for the React library that receives an URL and a time period, in milliseconds.
When mounted, this component must periodically do an HTTP GET request to the provided URL. The result of the request should be presented in a `textarea`:

* If the result was an HTTP response message, then the `textarea` must contain the response's body.
* If the result was an exception, then the `textarea` must contain the exception text.

The component should also show an indication if an HTTP request is pending or not.

The component must react to changes in its properties.
There must be at most one pending HTTP request at any time.

Create an example usage of this component, by using a form with two `input` elements to collect the URL and the temporal period.
